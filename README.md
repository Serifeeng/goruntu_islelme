# Image Processing Applications

This repository contains basic image processing applications developed using Python as part of a university-level Image Processing course.  
Various image processing techniques have been implemented in accordance with theoretical concepts.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Project Structure and Contents

The following image processing techniques are implemented in this project:

1. **Image Preprocessing**  
   Noise removal, normalization, and basic preprocessing steps

2. **Edge Detection**  
   Edge detection using Sobel and Canny methods

3. **Histogram-Based Operations**  
   Histogram calculation and histogram equalization

4. **Color Space Transformations**  
   RGB, Grayscale, and HSV color space conversions

5. **Spatial Filtering and Sharpening**  
   Spatial filtering and image sharpening techniques

6. **Panoramic Image Creation**  
   Panoramic image creation using multiple images

## NOTE: Image paths may need to be updated for local environment
